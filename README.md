# Mapping_Earthquakes

This Module allow us to further develope the use of JavaScript to create interactive webpages with Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. We also discovered that GeoJSON data is the industry standard are use almost all of our tracking devices and as Data Analyst this is much needed told to have. As describe at the begining of the module we also learnt how to 
- Create branches in GitHub.
- Mearge braches with the Main.

These two items are amongst some of the most important aspect when developing project and working with groups. Team leader can look other team members work and determine fi it needs adjustment or it can be commited to the project.
